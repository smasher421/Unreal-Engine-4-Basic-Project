# Unreal-Engine-4-Basic-Project
This is the project I did for an interview at a startup. It's a basic 3rd person game in a medieval setting in which you need to collect certain objects and exit the scene. It features many assets that I've modeled inside the Unreal Editor


MAIN FEATURES:

-Basic character implementation inside a map  
-Implementation of an initial startup screen with interactive buttons
-Collectables which are needed to access the exit
-Ambient sounds
-Distinct objects to collect which feature animations aswell as an effect once they're collected
-Environment featuring many objects


Improvements to be added!
